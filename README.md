# Welcome to my pet project called TaskList ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created using Type Script, React Native and Async Storage to store the data.

## How to run the app:

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

Enjoy :)
